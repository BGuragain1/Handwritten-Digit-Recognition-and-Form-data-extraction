# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-and-Form-data-extraction

This is my final Year Project of my Undergraduate from Herald College Kathamandu. This project is a handwritten digit recognition that recognized handwritten digits from a physical form and convert the physical form data into digital form. The programming language used is python and it's libraries such as Tenserflow, keras, Django and openCV along with MYSQL for data storage.
